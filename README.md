Issue can be shown by running the tests from Xcode with `âŒ˜ + U` or by running snapshot

```
fastlane snapshot
```

The issue only occurs when the Geofence icon (hollow icon) is in the status bar since it has the same size as the network activity indicator.

```

The regular icon (solid icon) has a smaller size so the issue doesnt occur.
